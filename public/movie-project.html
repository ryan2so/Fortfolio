<p>
    Donnie Yan is main actor for this movie. Moreover he is a Consultant of martial arts instruction. The design of martial art for this movie is amazing and like real fighting. The Ornamental is very well. Therefore, this movie is a Legendary of action or martial movies for me!
</p>
<h3>Fast and Furious - Tokyo Drift</h3>
<p>
    As a car lover. I really enjoy this movie since it is narrated a high school teenager how to grow up to become a man. At the beginning, main character Sean is a rebellious youth. After series of events, such as being arrested, car crash, buddy dies and found his goal and love. Finally he learned how to take his responsibility and get over his enemy. That is a great inspirational story!
